<p>
The
Bibliotheca Polyglotta (BP, <a href="https://www.philology.no/bp">https://www.philology.no/bp</a>)
of which the Thesaurus Literaturae Buddhicae (TLB) is a part, is an
online, open access,
parallel corpus conceived as a tool to study the "Grand
Multilinguals", i.e the important texts throughout history that
had a great cross-cultural and cross-national impact on politics,
religion, science and cultures in general (e.g. the Bible, or
Aristotles’ and Plato’s works). BP is connected with a project
named "Multiligualism, Linguae Francae and the Global History of
Religious and Scientific Concepts" whose main goal is to study
and describe the flow of concepts between areas that have different
languages, but which by diffusion of concepts come to share various
systems of knowledge, in the belief that this can provide essential
insights into history and how our conceptual frames are historically
created (Braarvig &amp; Geller 2018).</p>
<p>
	The scope of the texts in BP is wide, but its
emphasis is on texts with great diffusion and many translations
globally before the Renaissance. Thus, in addition to parallel
Buddhist texts in Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, Tibetan and other Buddhist
languages, it contains, among others, parallel versions of Ancient
Greek texts in Latin, Syriac and Arabic, Latin texts with their
historical translations into German, French and other European
languages, and Hittite-Akkadian or Hurrian-Hittite parallel texts.
However, also later texts have been occasionally integrated, like the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, probably the most important
"Grand Multilingual" of the present day, and a rich library
of parallel texts of Henrik Ibsen, the only Norwegian multilingual
text to ever have some real global impact, and a great multilingual
reception.</p>
<p>
	The
dialectics between a Lingua Franca as donor language of concepts and
knowledge systems, and the multilingual situation created when such
knowledge systems are translated into various receiving languages
which wishes to accommodate the concepts from the Lingua Franca, is a
crucial process. The study of such process will, according to our
view, give essential insights into history and into how our
conceptual frames are historically created (Braarvig 2018).
The BP will, thus, with its growing material, serve as a tool for the
global history of ideas. The main goal of BP is thus different from
(and complementary to) the main goals of corpora built for syntactic
and pragmatic analysis, like the parallel biblical texts in a number
of old Indo-European languages contained in the PROIEL Treebank
(Haug &amp; Løndahl 2008; <a href="https://proiel.github.io/">https://proiel.github.io/</a>),
now searchable through Syntacticus (<a href="http://syntacticus.org/">http://syntacticus.org/)</a>.</p>
<p>
	When a search for a particular concept or word is
performed, references to that particular concept from many
writing-cultures are accessed. This is made possible by the fact that
most of the texts in the parallel corpus also have a translation into
English – the present main Lingua Franca.  The word(s) resulting
from the searches are shown in the sentence in which they appear in
any language searched, and the user can go from each of these results
to the multilingual record where the sentence, or "smallest
semantic unit above word", as we call it, is represented in its
multilingual set up. In this way the BP is a kind of sentence
lexicon, which builds on the principle that a word only gets its
meaning in a context.</p>
<p>
	The next development of the BP, of which some
preparatory programming work has been done, will be to generate word
by word indices from the multilingual sentence by sentence records.</p>
