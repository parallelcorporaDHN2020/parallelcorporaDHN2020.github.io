<p><b>Types
of translationese and register variation in English-to-Russian
professional translation </b>
</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>This
research relies on several parallel and comparable corpora to explore
the linguistic properties of texts translated from English into
Russian by professional translators across a variety of registers. It
continues the line of investigations into the nature of translated
texts powerfully put forward by Mona
Baker (1993). In
the translationese studies it is maintained that translations are
statistically different from the originally authored texts in the
target language, and their distinctive features are usually revealed
through the comparison of translational corpora to genre- and domain-
comparable non translations in the same language. The parallel
component in this type of research is used to establish whether the
languages in the translation pair are dissimilar with respect to a
given feature and which linguistic phenomena are likely to trigger
translationese given the comparative analysis of the languages,
represented by the corpora.</p>
<p>On
the corpus resources side of the project, we explore the available
English-Russian parallel corpora and formats and make use of
self-compiled ones to build a register-balanced corpus for
translationese studies. 
</p>
<p>To
capture translationese, we develop a set of human-interpretable
lexicogrammatic features shared by the two languages and known to be
translationese indicators. Most of them are inspired by the previous
research and intuitions in translation and translationese studies
(Chesterman, 2010; Baroni &amp; Bernardini, 2006; Rabinovich &amp;
Wintner, 2016; Volansky et al., 2015⁠), contrastive analysis and
register studies. It includes the features that are empirically
confirmed as relevant for the translationese detection task (for the
purposes of this research, by univariate significance testing).
Translationese indicators are extracted from Universal Dependencies
(UD) annotation (Straka &amp; Straková, 2017)⁠, following a set of
patterns similar to those suggested by Douglas Biber⁠ (1988) and
adopted, for example, to the analysis of German translations by
Stella Neumann (2013) for German and by Katinskaya and Sharoff
(2015)⁠ for Russian. Our translationese indicators include
type-to-token ratio, sentence length, frequencies of morphological
forms (ex. non-finite forms of verb), syntactic relations (ex.
clausal complements), syntactic functions (ex. modal predicates),
word classes (ex. pronouns, discourse markers). It is known that the
results of this type of research are contingent on the quality of the
corpus annotation and feature extraction (Evert &amp; Neumann,
2017)⁠. While it is unrealistically labour-intensive to verify the
quality of out feature extraction by a human, in selecting the UD
model for each language, we relied on the pre-trained models that
returned most accurate results for our features and have the highest
mean accuracy for UPOS (93.6/97.9), UFeats (94.4/93.7), Lemma
(96.1/96.6) and Unlabelled attachment score (UAS) (80.8/87.9)
reported at the respective UD page<sup><a name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym">1</a></sup>.
At the time of writing, it is 2.2 for English Web Treebank
(English-EWT) and 2.3 for Russian-SynTagRus treebank, with the values
indicated by figures in the brackets above for English and Russian
respectively . 
</p>
<p>Typical
translationese features for English-Russian translation include the
overuse of relative clauses, copula verbs, modal predicates,
analytical passives, overuse of generic nouns and all types of
pronouns as shown in the examples below. Probably, none of the
sentences below can be considered ungrammatical, but there is a
Master Yoda -style foreign sound to them (all examples are real-life
student translations from Russian Learner Translator corpus (Kutuzov
&amp; Kunilovskaya, 2014)<sup><a name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym">2</a></sup>.

evolved from the prehistoric pendants.<br> Ожерелье – первое
нагрудное украшение, <b>которое</b> занимало
место на всей груди, <b>котор</b><b>о</b><b>е</b>
стало основой для подвесок<br> [Necklace – first
chest decoration, which covered the whole chest, which became the
basis for pendants].</p>
<p>
(2) …there are many self-employed people who manage to get money
from others by means of falsely pretending to provide them with some
benefit or service…<br> Более того, <b>есть</b> много
<b>людей</b>, работающих на себя, <b>которые</b>
получают деньги обманным путем<br> [Moreover,
there are many people, working for themselves, who get the money in a
deceitful way].</p>
<p>
(3) ...differences in self-efficacy may simply mean that some
teachers struggle to identify solutions to problems beyond their
circle of control.<br> ...разница в самооценке <b>может
означать </b>лишь то, что некоторые учителя
испытывают сложности в нахождении
решений задач <b>за пределами того, чем</b>
они <b>могут управлять</b><br> [...difference in
self-evaluation can mean only that some teachers run into
difficulties in finding tolitions to tasks beyond the scope of what
is under their contol].</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Further
on, in this talk we introduce a method to calculate the amount of
translationese manifested in the data and present its comparisons
with the alter native strategies as well as the considerations about
the role of the non-translated reference corpus in this line of
research. By placing translations into the same feature space as
their sources and the genre-comparable non-translated reference texts
in the target language, we observe two separate translationese
effects: a shift of translations into the gap between the source and
the target languages and a shift away from either language. These
trends are linked to the features that contribute to each of the
effects. Methodologically, we rely on a selection of supervised and
unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as Principle Component
Analysis and Support Vector Machine classification, to explore our
data and validate the results. In the end, we describe the observed
variation of the professional norm across several registers at hand
and compare the results for humans to machine translations.
