<b>Plans for using texts from
public authorities for creating a partly
parallel Meänkieli corpus</b></p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
A parallel corpus consisting of texts from Swedish public authorities
has previously been made freely available within The National
Language Bank of Sweden.<a name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym">0</a>
We plan to gradually extend this corpus by adding texts
written in the national minority languages of Sweden [4], i.e.
all varieties of Meänkieli, Finnish, Romani Chib, Yiddish and
Sami that are spoken in Sweden. As a first step, we will collect
texts published in Meänkieli on the web pages of public agencies and
local municipalities. Where available, we will also collect Finnish,
English and Swedish texts that are parallel to the retrieved
Meänkieli texts. These texts are often originally written in Swedish
and then translated into other languages.</p>
<p>
Meänkieli texts published by Swedish authorities are usually (i)
thematically narrow, (ii) limited in size, and (iii) written by a
small number of authors and translators. As these texts have
typically been translated from Swedish, they could also be considered
as belonging to a somewhat constructed genre, which might be
influenced by the source language.</p>
<p>
However, although there are corpora collections that include
Meänkieli texts [3], the general availability of language resources
and language tools for Meänkieli is scarce [1]. Therefore, despite
its limitations, the planned corpus could form a useful resource,
e.g. for gaining more examples of how the language is used, and as an
input for creating some types of language processing tools. In
particular, we estimate that the resource will become valuable, since
it will be freely available, and since it will contain parallel and
semi-parallel texts.</p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>
Using Meänkieli as the example language, we plan to create a
semi-automatic pipeline for collecting parallel corpora with texts
written in the minority languages of Sweden. The pipeline will
consist of the following steps: (i) manual selection of which html
web pages with Meänkieli texts to download, (ii) automatic
extraction of the actual texts, (iii) automatic sentence-alignment of
those texts that have been (manually) estimated to be parallel enough
for this to be possible, (iv) manual word-alignment for a small
subset of the parallel texts, and finally, (v) manual quality control
of the automatic text extraction and sentence-alignment. For step
(iii), we plan to use the Bitextor<a name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym">0</a>
tool [2], which we will provide with a bilingual
resource in the form of a Swedish-Meänkieli dictionary for
performing the alignment.</p>
<p>
After creating a first version of the corpus, we plan to explore to
what extent more steps in the pipeline can be fully or partly
automated. For instance, (i) whether relevant Meänkieli texts and
parallel texts in other languages can be automatically identified
with the use of automatic language identification and the use of
automatic alignment methods, and (ii) whether manual word alignment
can be simplified by providing automatic pre-alignments that the user
can correct.</p>
<p>
Using the knowledge gained from the construction of a corpus-creating
pipeline for Meänkieli, we plan to continue by creating similar
corpora for the other national minority languages of Sweden.</p>
