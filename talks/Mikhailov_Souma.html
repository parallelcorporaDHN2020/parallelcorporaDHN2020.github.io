MLCCA: a Finnish-Russian mixed type corpus
<p>
Mikhail Mikhailov and Julia Souma (Tampere
University, Finland)</p>
<p>
Parallel corpora are very important for developing
translating technologies of all kinds as well as for comparative
language studies. The field is developing rapidly, but still there is
not enough data, especially for smaller languages (see e.g. Mikhailov
&amp; Cooper 2016, Doval &amp; Sánchez Nieto 2019).</p>
<p>
In our talk a new Finnish-Russian corpus will be
presented. The Multilingual Corpus of Contracts and Agreements
(MLCCA) compiled at the Tampere University includes both parallel and
comparable texts.</p>
<p>
The text type of contract is ubiquitous:
communities of all sorts as well as individuals have to constantly
make agreements to guarantee progress and stability. The documents
can be very simple and very complicated, they can be done in two or
more languages, or just in one.</p>
<p>
MLCCA contains different types of contracts and
agreements – treaties, agreements between states, ministries,
cities, companies, universities as well as lower level agreements and
contracts between small enterprises or physical persons. Most of the
texts of the corpus are real documents concluded between real
organizations, others are templates for documents. The texts with
rare exceptions were collected from open sources on the Internet. The
time of creation of the texts is from the beginning of the 1990-ies
to the present.</p>
<p>
The parallel part of the corpus contains 56
Finland-Russia treaties, 13 lower level agreements and 10 license
agreements.</p>
<p>
The comparable part contains 300 contracts and
agreements in the Finnish language and 340 contracts and agreements
in the Russian language.</p>
<p>
Now the size of the whole corpus is 590 thousand
running words in Russian and 350 thousand running words in Finnish.</p>
<p>
The main challenges of compiling MLCCA:</p>
<p>
a) 	certain types of agreements such as agreements
between companies are usually confidential and cannot be made
available;</p>
<p>
b)	some types of agreements such as agreements on
cooperation between sister cities are not confidential, but were
never published in print neither on the web;</p>
<p>
c) 	some agreements on partnership are done in
English language only or in Russian and English languages;</p>
<p>
d) 	the copyright problem: one of the possible
sources are books of templates, which are subject to IPR;</p>
<p>
e)	it is sometimes difficult to collect comparable
documents in Finnish and in Russian, some very typical for Russia
contracts are almost never done in Finland;</p>
<p>
f) 	it is difficult to achieve the harmony in size
between Finnish and Russian monolingual parts: Finnish contracts are
often arranged as tables or fill-out forms while Russian contracts
are regular cohesive texts. Therefore, there is large difference in
numbers of words between Russian and Finnish subcorpora, although the
number of texts is quite close.</p>
<p>
The corpus can be further extended with bilateral
agreements, license agreements, and comparable documents.</p>
<p>
MLCCA can be used for contrastive studies of
language for special purposes (LSP) as well as for practical work of
translators and copy-editors. The corpus will be available online via
Tampere University and the Language Bank of Finland.</p>
<p>
MLCCA was compiled with financial support from the
FIN-CLARIN consortium.
